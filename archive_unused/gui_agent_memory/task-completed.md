Task Completed

I have applied a series of fixes to the `TradeNationSignalEA_v2.mq4` file and its included `.mqh` libraries. These changes address the compiler errors you reported, including the unexpected tokens, undeclared identifiers, and system function overrides.

The primary corrections involved:

1. __Resolving Type Errors__: Ensured all custom classes (`SignalDashboard`, `ConditionalTrader`, `SignalParser`) and structs (`SignalData`) are correctly defined and included.
2. __Removing Function Conflicts__: Removed user-defined functions that conflicted with MQL4's built-in functions.
3. __Fixing File Handling__: Corrected the file search loop and handle type.
4. __Cleaning up Properties__: Removed a property that was incorrect for an Expert Advisor.

I have now completed the necessary code modifications. Please recompile the `mt4_ea\TradeNationSignalEA_v2.mq4` file in your MetaEditor. The previous errors should be resolved.
