- **New**: 3-page trading platform with clear purpose separation

#### New Page Structure

**1. Chart Viewer** (Development/Testing)
- Purpose: Test chart functionalities and indicators
- Role: Dev sandbox, not primary user interface
- Features: Data source toggle, indicator testing

**2. Strategy Lab** (Core: Backtesting)
- Purpose: Strategy development and validation
- Layout: 3-column (Strategy selector | Equity curve + metrics | Trade history)
- Features: Upload strategies, backtest execution, performance analysis
- Priority: **PRIMARY FOCUS** for strategy validation

**3. Trading Hub** (Core: Live Execution)
- Purpose: Real-time signal generation and trade execution
- Layout: 3-column (Positions | Live chart with signals | Signal panel + execute)
- Features: Live signals, confidence scores, one-click execution
- Priority: **PRIMARY FOCUS** for automated trading

#### Design System
**Solana-Inspired Aesthetic:**
- Dark theme (#0a0e1a base, #1e293b cards)
- Green accents (#10b981 for success/buy)
- Red accents (#ef4444 for danger/sell)
- Clean typography (Inter font family)
- Card-based layouts with glass effects
- Minimal borders, high contrast

#### Enhanced Indicator System
**Modal-Based Configuration:**
- Dropdown selector for indicator type
- Modal opens with parameter inputs

- Clean UI without clutter

**New Indicators to Add:**
1. **Schaff Trend Cycle** - Cycle-based trend indicator
   - Fast Length: 10, Slow Length: 20
   - %D(MACD) Length: 3, %D(PF) Length: 3

2. **DeMarker** - Price exhaustion indicator
   - Period: 10

3. **CCI (Commodity Channel Index)** - Momentum oscillator
   - Period: 20

## 🎯 Strategic Priorities

### 1. Backtesting is King 👑
- Strategy Lab is the primary development interface
- Fast iteration: Strategy → Data → Backtest → Analyze → Refine
- Performance metrics dashboard for strategy validation

### 2. Live Trading is the Goal 🎯
- Trading Hub is the execution layer
- Real-time signal generation from validated strategies
- One-click execution with safety controls

### 3. Chart Viewer is for Testing 🔧
- Development sandbox for indicator validation
- Not the primary user interface
- Focus on functionality testing only
