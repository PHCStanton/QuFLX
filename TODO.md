## 🤝 Contributing

For internal development team:
1. Check this TODO for current priorities
2. Update status when starting/completing tasks
3. Document new features in relevant README files
4. Keep .agent-memory/project-status.md current

## 📌 Notes

- **Architecture**: Capabilities-first design is working well
- **Performance**: Socket.IO handles real-time updates efficiently
- **Data**: CSV format is sufficient for MVP, database migration can wait
- **Strategy**: Quantum Flux provides solid baseline for comparison
- **GUI**: React + Vite + TailwindCSS stack is productive
