### ✅ Critical Bug Fixes & Performance Optimization (October 13, 2025) - COMPLETE

**4 Critical Issues Resolved - Platform Stability & Chart Performance**

- [x] **Chrome Reconnection Bug**: Fixed `.seconds` → `.total_seconds()` for multi-minute disconnections
- [x] **API Encapsulation**: Replaced direct `CANDLES` access with `get_all_candles()` method
- [x] **Safe Timeframe Calculation**: Added try/except with proper fallback and error logging
- [x] **CRITICAL Chart Performance**: Refactored to use `update()` for incremental updates (10-100x faster)
  - `setData()` only for initial load
  - `update()` for new/forming candles
  - Smart detection via `prevDataLengthRef`
- [x] **Comprehensive Testing**: Verified in CSV and Platform modes
- [x] **Architect Review**: All fixes verified and approved ✅

**Performance Impact**: Chart rendering now O(1) instead of O(n) for real-time updates

---

### ✅ CSV Persistence Fix for streaming_server.py (October 11, 2025) - COMPLETE

**Critical bug fix: --collect-stream argument not saving data**

- [x] **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified `stream_from_chrome()` bypassing `_output_streaming_data()`
- [x] **Direct Persistence Implementation**: Added CSV persistence in real-time data flow (lines 367-434)
- [x] **Tick Persistence**: Extract and save tick data after `_process_realtime_update()`
- [x] **Candle Persistence**: Save closed candles using `last_closed_candle_index` tracking
- [x] **Code Cleanup**: Removed redundant persistence from `extract_candle_for_emit()`
- [x] **Fallback Safety**: Kept patch for alternative code paths
- [x] **Architect Review**: Verified and approved ✅

**Impact**: CSV collection now fully operational when running `streaming_server.py --collect-stream both`

---

### ✅ Platform Mode State Machine & Explicit Detection Flow (October 10, 2025) - COMPLETE

**Complete architecture overhaul - Production ready, architect-verified**

#### State Machine Implementation
- [x] 6-state pattern: idle, ready, detecting, asset_detected, streaming, error
- [x] State transitions based on Chrome connection and user actions
- [x] Exclusive control: State machine is single authority for Platform mode
- [x] Zero bypass paths: All auto-start and legacy toggles removed

#### Backend Asset Detection
- [x] `detect_asset` Socket.IO endpoint for explicit asset detection
- [x] Real-time query from PocketOption via `data_streamer.get_current_asset()`
- [x] Event emissions: `asset_detected` (success) or `asset_detection_failed` (error)
- [x] Frontend useWebSocket hook properly wired with detection handlers

#### Stream Control Panel UI
- [x] State-based controls replace asset dropdown in Platform mode
- [x] Dynamic UI based on state machine state
- [x] Statistics panel now only shows in CSV mode
- [x] Chart data properly clears when switching from CSV to Platform

#### Critical Race Condition Fixes
- [x] Removed all auto-start logic from reconnection callback
- [x] Separated `selectedAsset` (CSV) from `detectedAsset` (Platform)
- [x] State machine reset on reconnection (READY/IDLE, no stream restart)
- [x] `handleStartStream` exclusively uses `detectedAsset`
- [x] Removed legacy `toggleLiveMode` function (bypass prevention)

**Key Benefits:**
- Sequential logic: Detect → Start → Stream → Visualize
- Zero race conditions, functional simplicity
- Auto-detection from actual PocketOption state
- Production ready with architect verification

---

### ✅ Real-Time Streaming Phases 1-5 (October 9, 2025) - COMPLETE

#### Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure Fixes
- [x] Fixed eventlet/WebSocket configuration (eliminated AssertionError)
- [x] Added ChromeDriver support with fast-fail port checking (1s timeout)
- [x] Backend gracefully handles missing Chrome connection
- [x] Chrome status monitoring with 5-second polling
- [x] Clear error messages when Chrome unavailable

#### Phase 2: Stream Data Collection
- [x] Implemented `--collect-stream {tick,candle,both,none}` CLI argument
- [x] Integrated StreamPersistenceManager for optional persistence
- [x] Rotating CSV writers (default: 100 candles, 1000 ticks per file)
- [x] Data saves to `data/data_output/assets_data/realtime_stream/`
- [x] Fixed tick persistence method signature bug
- [x] Session timestamp-based file naming

#### Phase 3: Frontend Data Provider Separation
- [x] Removed "Auto" mode - enforced explicit CSV vs Platform selection
- [x] Fixed false live state (prevents activation without connections)
- [x] Added disconnect handling (auto-stop on Chrome/backend disconnect)
- [x] Implemented asset validation (prevents invalid assets on mode switch)
- [x] Fixed race condition (validates assets before streaming)
- [x] Platform mode locked to 1M timeframe
- [x] CSV mode supports all timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h)

#### Phase 4: Asset Focus Integration
- [x] Verified backend API methods (set_asset_focus, release_asset_focus)
- [x] Confirmed Socket.IO events properly wired
- [x] Frontend uses correct event sequence
- [x] Asset filtering at capability level working

#### Phase 5: Reconnection Lifecycle Management
- [x] Backend state reset function (clears candle buffers, persistence tracking)
- [x] Chrome auto-reconnection with rate limiting (3 attempts/min, exponential backoff)
- [x] Socket.IO session tracking for reconnection detection
- [x] Event emissions (backend_reconnected, chrome_reconnected with status)
- [x] Frontend reconnection callback for automatic state cleanup
- [x] Automatic data recovery (CSV reload or stream restart)
- [x] Visual UI indicators for reconnection status (auto-hide after 3s)
- [x] Comprehensive reconnection event logging

## 🏗️ Architecture & Data Flow

### Two Distinct Data Pipelines

#### 1. Historical/Topdown Collection (Separate)
```
capabilities/data_streaming_csv_save.py
   ↓
scripts/custom_sessions/favorites_select_topdown_collect.py
   ↓
data/data_output/assets_data/data_collect/
   ↓
Used for: Backtesting, strategy development
Status: ✅ Working independently
```

#### 2. Real-Time Streaming (Current Focus)
```
capabilities/data_streaming.py (RealtimeDataStreaming)
   ↓
streaming_server.py (Flask-SocketIO, port 3001)
   ↓
Socket.IO Events → Frontend (port 5000)
   ↓
Optional: data/data_output/assets_data/realtime_stream/
   ↓
Used for: Live trading, GUI visualization
Status: ✅ Production Ready
```

### Frontend Chart Architecture
```
DataAnalysis.jsx
   ↓
MultiPaneChart.jsx (Chart Container)
   ├── Main Chart (Candlesticks + Overlays: SMA, EMA, Bollinger)
   ├── RSI Pane (Separate synchronized chart)
   └── MACD Pane (Separate synchronized chart)
   ↓
IndicatorConfig.jsx (Dynamic indicator management)
```

### Platform Mode State Flow
```
User Journey:
1. Select "Platform" data provider
   ↓ (Chrome connected)
2. State: READY → Click "Detect Asset"
   ↓
3. State: DETECTING → Backend queries PocketOption
   ↓
4. State: ASSET_DETECTED → Shows detected asset
   ↓
5. Click "Start Stream"
   ↓
6. State: STREAMING → Real-time chart updates with indicators
   ↓
7. Click "Stop Stream"
   ↓
8. State: READY → Back to start

Reconnection:
- Backend reconnects → State resets to READY/IDLE (no auto-start)
- Chart clears → User must explicitly restart detection flow
```

## 🎓 Technical Notes

### Stream Collection Commands
```bash
# No collection (default)
uv run python streaming_server.py

# Collect candles only
uv run python streaming_server.py --collect-stream candle

# Collect ticks only  
uv run python streaming_server.py --collect-stream tick

# Collect both with custom chunk sizes
uv run python streaming_server.py --collect-stream both \
  --candle-chunk-size 200 --tick-chunk-size 2000
```

### Platform Mode State Machine
```javascript
STREAM_STATES = {
  IDLE: 'idle',                    // Waiting for Chrome
  READY: 'ready',                  // Ready to detect
  DETECTING: 'detecting',          // Querying PocketOption
  ASSET_DETECTED: 'asset_detected', // Asset found, ready to stream
  STREAMING: 'streaming',          // Active streaming
  ERROR: 'error'                   // Detection/streaming error
}
```

### Frontend Chart System
```javascript
// Time Synchronization Pattern
mainChart.timeScale().subscribeVisibleTimeRangeChange((timeRange) => {
  oscillatorPane.timeScale().setVisibleRange({
    from: timeRange.from,
    to: timeRange.to
  });
});

// Memory Management
useEffect(() => {
  // Setup
  const chart = createChart(containerRef.current);
  const callback = (timeRange) => { /* ... */ };
  chart.timeScale().subscribeVisibleTimeRangeChange(callback);
  
  // Cleanup
  return () => {
    chart.timeScale().unsubscribeVisibleTimeRangeChange(callback);
    chart.remove();
  };
}, []);
```

### Important Design Decisions
- Historical collection ≠ Real-time streaming (separate pipelines)
- Platform mode uses state machine (no auto-start or race conditions)
- Asset detection from PocketOption (no hardcoded defaults)
- Chrome connection optional (graceful degradation)
- Backpressure protection (1000-item limit prevents memory issues)
- Dynamic indicators with full time-series data from backend
- Time-based synchronization for multi-pane charts
- Proper resource cleanup prevents memory leaks
