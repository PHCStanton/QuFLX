All core streaming infrastructure complete and stable - **Ready for chart refinement and comprehensive testing** 🎯

---

## 🎉 Recently Completed

### ✅ CSV Persistence Fix for streaming_server.py (October 11, 2025) - COMPLETE

**Critical bug fix: --collect-stream argument not saving data**

- [x] **Root Cause Analysis**: Identified `stream_from_chrome()` bypassing `_output_streaming_data()`
- [x] **Direct Persistence Implementation**: Added CSV persistence in real-time data flow (lines 367-434)
- [x] **Tick Persistence**: Extract and save tick data after `_process_realtime_update()`
- [x] **Candle Persistence**: Save closed candles using `last_closed_candle_index` tracking
- [x] **Code Cleanup**: Removed redundant persistence from `extract_candle_for_emit()`
- [x] **Fallback Safety**: Kept patch for alternative code paths
- [x] **Architect Review**: Verified and approved ✅

**Impact**: CSV collection now fully operational when running `streaming_server.py --collect-stream both`

### ✅ Asset Name Normalization & Chart Rendering Fix (October 10, 2025) - COMPLETE

**Complete solution for live streaming chart visualization**

- [x] **Phase 1 (Filtering)**: Fixed asset name mismatch in data filtering
  - Added `_normalize_asset_name()` function (removes underscores/slashes/spaces, uppercase)
  - Applied to 3 filtering locations (historical, realtime, streaming)
  - Format variations handled: USDJPY_otc vs USDJPYOTC
  
- [x] **Phase 2 (Retrieval)**: Extended normalization to candle retrieval
  - Added normalized lookup to `get_latest_candle()` method
  - Added normalized lookup to `get_all_candles()` method
  - Two-tier lookup: Direct O(1) → Normalized fallback search
  - Resolves dictionary key mismatch preventing `candle_update` emissions
  
- [x] **Result**: Chart successfully rendering with live streaming data ✅
- [x] CSV persistence unchanged (files still saved as EURUSD_otc format)
- [x] Architect review approved (no regressions, acceptable performance)

**Impact**: Complete end-to-end fix - data flows from WebSocket → filtering → retrieval → emissions → chart rendering

### ✅ Platform Mode State Machine & Explicit Detection Flow (October 10, 2025) - COMPLETE

**Complete architecture overhaul - Production ready, architect-verified**

#### State Machine Implementation
- [x] 6-state pattern: idle, ready, detecting, asset_detected, streaming, error
- [x] State transitions based on Chrome connection and user actions
- [x] Exclusive control: State machine is single authority for Platform mode
- [x] Zero bypass paths: All auto-start and legacy toggles removed

#### Backend Asset Detection
- [x] `detect_asset` Socket.IO endpoint for explicit asset detection
- [x] Real-time query from PocketOption via `data_streamer.get_current_asset()`
- [x] Event emissions: `asset_detected` (success) or `asset_detection_failed` (error)
- [x] Frontend useWebSocket hook properly wired with detection handlers

#### Stream Control Panel UI
- [x] State-based controls replace asset dropdown in Platform mode
- [x] Dynamic UI based on state machine state:
  - IDLE: "Waiting for Chrome connection..."
  - READY: "Detect Asset from PocketOption" button
  - DETECTING: Spinner with "Detecting asset..."
  - ASSET_DETECTED: Detected asset + "Start Stream" button
  - STREAMING: Streaming asset + "Stop Stream" button
  - ERROR: Error message + "Retry Detection" button
- [x] Statistics panel now only shows in CSV mode
- [x] Chart data properly clears when switching from CSV to Platform

#### Critical Race Condition Fixes
- [x] Removed all auto-start logic from reconnection callback
- [x] Separated `selectedAsset` (CSV) from `detectedAsset` (Platform)
- [x] State machine reset on reconnection (READY/IDLE, no stream restart)
- [x] `handleStartStream` exclusively uses `detectedAsset`
- [x] Removed legacy `toggleLiveMode` function (bypass prevention)

**Key Benefits:**
- Sequential logic: Detect → Start → Stream → Visualize
- Zero race conditions, functional simplicity
- Auto-detection from actual PocketOption state
- Production ready with architect verification

## 🏗️ Architecture & Data Flow

### Two Distinct Data Pipelines

#### 1. Historical/Topdown Collection (Separate)
```
capabilities/data_streaming_csv_save.py
   ↓
scripts/custom_sessions/favorites_select_topdown_collect.py
   ↓
data/data_output/assets_data/data_collect/
   ↓
Used for: Backtesting, strategy development
Status: ✅ Working independently
```

#### 2. Real-Time Streaming (Current Focus)
```
capabilities/data_streaming.py (RealtimeDataStreaming)
   ↓
streaming_server.py (Flask-SocketIO, port 3001)
   ↓
Socket.IO Events → Frontend (port 5000)
   ↓
Optional: data/data_output/assets_data/realtime_stream/
   ↓
Used for: Live trading, GUI visualization
Status: ✅ Phases 1-6 complete (Production Ready)
```

### Platform Mode State Flow
```
User Journey:
1. Select "Platform" data provider
   ↓ (Chrome connected)
2. State: READY → Click "Detect Asset"
   ↓
3. State: DETECTING → Backend queries PocketOption
   ↓
4. State: ASSET_DETECTED → Shows detected asset
   ↓
5. Click "Start Stream"
   ↓
6. State: STREAMING → Real-time chart updates
   ↓
7. Click "Stop Stream"
   ↓
8. State: READY → Back to start

Reconnection:
- Backend reconnects → State resets to READY/IDLE (no auto-start)
- Chart clears → User must explicitly restart detection flow
```

### Key Components

**Backend (streaming_server.py)**
- Flask-SocketIO on port 3001
- Uses `capabilities/data_streaming.py` (RealtimeDataStreaming)
- Chrome connection on port 9222 (optional, graceful degradation)
- Socket.IO events: start_stream, stop_stream, change_asset, detect_asset, candle_update
- Optional persistence: --collect-stream {tick,candle,both,none}

**Frontend (React GUI, port 5000)**
- Data sources: CSV (historical) + Platform WebSocket (live)
- CSV mode: Dropdown selector, statistics panel, all timeframes
- Platform mode: State-based controls, stream status, 1M only
- State machine: 6 states (idle, ready, detecting, asset_detected, streaming, error)
- Backpressure: 1000-item buffer limit

## 🎓 Technical Notes

### Stream Collection Commands
```bash
# No collection (default)
uv run python streaming_server.py

# Collect candles only
uv run python streaming_server.py --collect-stream candle

# Collect ticks only  
uv run python streaming_server.py --collect-stream tick

# Collect both with custom chunk sizes
uv run python streaming_server.py --collect-stream both \
  --candle-chunk-size 200 --tick-chunk-size 2000
```

### Platform Mode State Machine
```javascript
STREAM_STATES = {
  IDLE: 'idle',                    // Waiting for Chrome
  READY: 'ready',                  // Ready to detect
  DETECTING: 'detecting',          // Querying PocketOption
  ASSET_DETECTED: 'asset_detected', // Asset found, ready to stream
  STREAMING: 'streaming',          // Active streaming
  ERROR: 'error'                   // Detection/streaming error
}
```

### Important Design Decisions
- Historical collection ≠ Real-time streaming (separate pipelines)
- Platform mode uses state machine (no auto-start or race conditions)
- Asset detection from PocketOption (no hardcoded defaults)
- Chrome connection optional (graceful degradation)
- Backpressure protection (1000-item limit prevents memory issues)

---

**Current State Summary:**
- Real-time streaming infrastructure complete (Phases 1-6)
- Platform mode state machine production-ready
- Zero race conditions or auto-start bypasses
- Backend stable with Chrome disconnect handling
- Frontend enforces explicit data provider selection
- Stream persistence optional and configurable
