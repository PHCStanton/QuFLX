 Completed Phases
Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure Fixes
Fixed eventlet WebSocket configuration (eliminated AssertionError)
Resolved import issues and consolidated streaming servers
Added ChromeDriver support with fast-fail port checking (1s timeout on port 9222)
Backend now starts gracefully with/without Chrome connection
Phase 2: Stream Data Collection
Implemented --collect-stream {tick,candle,both,none} CLI argument
Integrated StreamPersistenceManager for optional data persistence
Rotating CSV writers with configurable chunk sizes (default: 100 candles, 1000 ticks)
Data saved to data/data_output/assets_data/realtime_stream/
Phase 3: Frontend Data Provider Separation
Removed "Auto" mode - enforced explicit CSV vs Platform selection
Fixed critical bugs:
âœ… False live state (prevented live mode without connections)
âœ… Disconnect handling (auto-stop stream on Chrome/backend disconnect)
âœ… Asset validation (prevents invalid assets between modes)
âœ… Race condition (validates assets before streaming)
Platform mode locked to 1M timeframe
CSV mode supports all timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h)
Phase 3.5: Code Quality Improvements
Fixed LSP error (added log_output parameter)
Corrected asset switching logic (uses changeAsset instead of redundant startStream)
Improved Chrome disconnect handling (proactive checks + stream_error events)
Phase 4: Asset Focus Integration
Verified complete implementation (no changes needed)
set_asset_focus() / release_asset_focus() working
Socket.IO events properly wired (start_stream, change_asset, stop_stream)
ðŸš§ Current Phase
Phase 5: Auto-Detection Features (In Discussion)
Current Behavior: Platform mode uses manual asset selection with focus lock

Proposed Enhancement Options:

Option A: Add "Auto-follow PocketOption UI" toggle
Enabled: Chart follows whatever asset user views in browser
Disabled: Chart stays locked to selected asset (current behavior)
Option B: Display auto-detected values (read-only indicator)
Shows what PocketOption is currently displaying
Helps user understand platform state
ðŸ“… Pending Phase
Phase 6: Comprehensive Testing & Validation
End-to-end workflow testing
Chrome disconnect/reconnect scenarios
Mode switching (CSV â†” Platform)
Asset switching in live mode
Stream persistence verification
