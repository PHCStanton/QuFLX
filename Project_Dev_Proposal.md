# QuantumFlux Trading Platform - Development Proposal

## Executive Summary

QuantumFlux is a sophisticated automated trading platform for PocketOption that leverages WebSocket data streaming, Selenium automation, and AI-driven trading strategies. The platform uses a hybrid Chrome session approach for persistent connections and real-time market data collection.

## Current Architecture Overview

### Core Foundation: `capabilities/data_streaming.py`

The `RealtimeDataStreaming` class serves as the foundation for all platform operations:

- **WebSocket Data Collection**: Intercepts and processes real-time market data from PocketOption
- **Candle Formation**: Converts tick data into OHLC candles with configurable timeframes
- **Session Synchronization**: Maintains user session state (asset, timeframe, authentication)
- **Multi-Mode Streaming**: Supports tick-only, candle-only, and combined data streams
- **CSV Export**: Automatic data persistence for historical analysis

### Key Components

#### 1. Hybrid Chrome Session Management (`start_hybrid_session.py`)
- Launches Chrome with remote debugging enabled (port 9222)
- Creates persistent user data directory for session continuity
- Enables WebSocket interception for real-time data

#### 2. Backend API (`backend.py`)
- FastAPI-based REST API with comprehensive endpoints
- Real-time WebSocket streaming for frontend clients
- Trading execution, strategy management, and health monitoring
- Circuit breaker pattern for external service reliability

#### 3. Capabilities Framework
- **Profile Scanning**: User account information extraction
- **Session Monitoring**: Real-time account balance and trade state
- **Trade Execution**: BUY/SELL operations with diagnostics
- **Asset Discovery**: Available trading instruments scanning
