**Key Rules to Follow:**  
1. **Simplicity First:** Prioritize straightforward solutions over complex ones.  
2. **Code Integrity:** Ensure all code is robust, maintainable, and adheres to best practices.  
3. **No Assumptions:** Verify all requirements and clarify uncertainties before proceeding.  
4. **Frontend & UX Considerations:** Design both frontend and UX with scalability and flexibility in mind.  
5. **Expert Standards:** Adhere to industry best practices as an AI Agent Coder and Architect.
6. **Avoid Unnecessary Files:** Do not create any files that are not essential to the project.
7. **MVP Focus:** The goal is a Minimum Viable Product - prioritize getting the system functional and stable.

**Notes:**
1. Use sequential thinking and the File Context Server for more precise analysis and results when necessary.
2. The Persistent Chrome Session is running, and the backend.py file has already been started.
