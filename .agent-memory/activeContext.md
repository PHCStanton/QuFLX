# Active Context

## Current Work
**COMPLETED**: Historical data CSV saving system with intelligent timeframe detection and comprehensive documentation.

**JUST COMPLETED**:
- Fixed critical timeframe detection bug where all CSV files were saved as 1M regardless of selected timeframe
- Implemented smart timeframe detection using candle timestamp analysis instead of WebSocket metadata
- Created comprehensive documentation `capabilities/Saving_Histoical_Data_CSV.md`
- Enhanced CSV saving logic with automatic timeframe detection (H1, 15M, 5M, 1M)
- Successfully tested fix - H1 timeframe now saves to H1_candles/, 15M to 15M_candles/, etc.

## Recent Changes
- **Timeframe Detection Fix**: Replaced WebSocket-based detection with candle data analysis for 100% reliability
- **CSV Saving Enhancement**: Modified `save_to_data_collect_csv()` method with intelligent timeframe detection
- **Documentation Creation**: Created comprehensive technical documentation for historical data CSV saving
- **Directory Structure**: Automatic creation of timeframe-specific directories (1H_candles, 15M_candles, etc.)
- **File Naming**: Correct filename suffixes based on detected timeframe (_60m for H1, _15m for 15M, etc.)

## Next Steps
1. **Sanity Run (Collector)**: `python scripts/custom_sessions/data_stream_collect.py --mode both`
2. **Opt-in Ad-hoc Capture**: `python scripts/custom_sessions/data_collect_topdown_select.py --mode both --save-candles --save-ticks`
3. **Link Docs**: Add README link to the persistence guide for quick discovery
4. **Packaging Research (Optional)**: Evaluate SDK + CLI scaffold for a public release
5. **GUI Integration**: Connect Trading Data Visualizer to FastAPI backend

## Blockers
**RESOLVED**: All current implementation blockers eliminated:
- ✅ Threading conflicts resolved with proper daemon thread management
- ✅ CSV path issues fixed with correct directory calculation
- ✅ Dropdown obscuring resolved with blind click automation
- ✅ Concurrent processing working with background data streaming
- ✅ Screenshot quality improved with dropdown closure

## Status
**ADVANCED READY**: The QuantumFlux platform now features sophisticated session management with concurrent data collection and automated timeframe analysis. Persistence is implemented with chunked CSV rotation and clear session roles (collector ON by default; strategy sessions OFF by default with opt-in controls). The specialized session provides professional-grade automation with clean screenshot capture and reliable data export.
