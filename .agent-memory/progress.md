### Phase 5: Backend Integration Solution (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Minimal Backend**: Clean FastAPI backend with direct capabilities integration
- **CLI Interface**: Comprehensive command-line tool (`qf.py`) for all operations
- **PowerShell Automation**: One-command platform startup (`scripts/start_all.ps1`)
- **Smoke Testing**: Automated system verification (`test_smoke.py`)
- **Documentation**: Complete user guide (`QUICKSTART.md`)

### Phase 6: Advanced Session Management (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Specialized Sessions**: Created `data_collect_topdown_select.py` with threading
- **Concurrent Processing**: Background data streaming with foreground topdown analysis
- **Blind Click Automation**: Safe dropdown closure before screenshots
- **CSV Path Resolution**: Fixed output directory calculation for reliable exports
- **Threading Architecture**: Proper daemon thread management for concurrent operations

### Phase 6.5: Streaming Persistence & Session Separation (✅ COMPLETED)
- Implemented `StreamPersistenceManager` with chunked CSV rotation (closed candles=100 rows/file, ticks=1000 rows/file)
- Defined session roles:
  - `data_stream_collect.py` = data collection (persistence ON by default)
  - `data_collect_topdown_select.py` and `TF_dropdown_open_close.py` = trading/strategy (persistence OFF by default; opt-in)
- Added opt-in controls via CLI flags: `--save-candles`, `--save-ticks`, `--candle-chunk-size`, `--tick-chunk-size`
- Added environment overrides: `QF_PERSIST`, `QF_PERSIST_CANDLES`, `QF_PERSIST_TICKS`
- Documented behavior and commands in `scripts/custom_sessions/Persistent_Data_How_it _Works.md`
- Save locations:
  - Candles: `data/data_output/assets_data/realtime_stream/1M_candle_data`
  - Ticks:   `data/data_output/assets_data/realtime_stream/1M_tick_data`

### Phase 7: CSV Timeframe Detection & Documentation (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Fixed timeframe detection where all CSV files were being saved as 1M regardless of selected timeframe
- **Smart Detection**: Replaced WebSocket metadata approach with intelligent candle data analysis for detecting H1, 15M, 5M, 1M intervals
- **Directory Organization**: Files now save to correct timeframe directories (1H_candles, 15M_candles, 5M_candles, 1M_candles)
- **File Naming**: Proper filename suffixes (_60m for H1, _15m for 15M, _5m for 5M, _1m for 1M)
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Created `capabilities/Saving_Histoical_Data_CSV.md` with complete technical reference
- **Testing Verified**: Confirmed fix works - H1 selections save to H1_candles, 15M to 15M_candles, etc.

### Agent Memory System (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Memory Structure**: Complete `.agent-memory/` directory with all required files
- **Project Context**: Comprehensive project documentation and goals
- **Technical Documentation**: Architecture patterns, technologies, and constraints
- **Development Guidelines**: `.agentrules` file with project-specific standards

## In Progress
**Optional**:
- Link README to the persistence guide for quick discovery
- Explore packaging the unofficial WebSocket client as an SDK + CLI (scaffold, docs, licensing)

## Planned Features

### Phase 6: GUI Integration (READY TO START)
- **Trading Data Visualizer**: Integration of `gui/Trading_Data_Visualizer` with FastAPI backend
- **Real-time Charts**: TradingView Lightweight Charts with live data streaming
- **Trade Controls**: GUI-based trade execution and strategy management
- **Dashboard Interface**: Comprehensive trading dashboard with account monitoring

### Future Enhancements (OPTIONAL)
- **Advanced Strategies**: Machine learning-based trading algorithms
- **Multi-Asset Support**: Expanded asset coverage beyond current favorites
- **Portfolio Management**: Multi-strategy portfolio optimization
- **Risk Analytics**: Advanced risk metrics and drawdown analysis
- **Mobile Interface**: Responsive web interface for mobile trading

## Known Issues

### Resolved Issues (✅ FIXED)
