- **CSV Path Resolution**: Fixed output directory calculation for reliable exports
- **Threading Architecture**: Proper daemon thread management for concurrent operations

### Phase 6.5: Streaming Persistence & Session Separation (✅ COMPLETED)
- Implemented `StreamPersistenceManager` with chunked CSV rotation (closed candles=100 rows/file, ticks=1000 rows/file)
- Defined session roles:
  - `data_stream_collect.py` = data collection (persistence ON by default)
  - `data_collect_topdown_select.py` and `TF_dropdown_open_close.py` = trading/strategy (persistence OFF by default; opt-in)
- Added opt-in controls via CLI flags: `--save-candles`, `--save-ticks`, `--candle-chunk-size`, `--tick-chunk-size`
- Added environment overrides: `QF_PERSIST`, `QF_PERSIST_CANDLES`, `QF_PERSIST_TICKS`
- Documented behavior and commands in `scripts/custom_sessions/Persistent_Data_How_it _Works.md`
- Save locations:
  - Candles: `data/data_output/assets_data/realtime_stream/1M_candle_data`
  - Ticks:   `data/data_output/assets_data/realtime_stream/1M_tick_data`

### Phase 7: CSV Timeframe Detection & Documentation (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Critical Bug Fix**: Fixed timeframe detection where all CSV files were being saved as 1M regardless of selected timeframe
- **Smart Detection**: Replaced WebSocket metadata approach with intelligent candle data analysis for detecting H1, 15M, 5M, 1M intervals
- **Directory Organization**: Files now save to correct timeframe directories (1H_candles, 15M_candles, 5M_candles, 1M_candles)
- **File Naming**: Proper filename suffixes (_60m for H1, _15m for 15M, _5m for 5M, _1m for 1M)
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Created `capabilities/Saving_Histoical_Data_CSV.md` with complete technical reference
- **Testing Verified**: Confirmed fix works - H1 selections save to H1_candles, 15M to 15M_candles, etc.

### Phase 8: GUI Integration & Backtesting (✅ COMPLETED)

- **Backtesting System**: Full React-based backtesting interface with Socket.IO integration
- **Historical Data Support**: Smart discovery of 100+ CSV files (OTC & HLOC formats)
- **Strategy Integration**: Quantum Flux strategy working with both backtesting and live data
- **Socket.IO Backend**: Handlers for backtest execution, data discovery, signal generation
- **Timeframe Filtering**: Frontend filters assets by selected timeframe (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h)

### Phase 9: GUI Backend Architecture Refactoring (✅ COMPLETED - October 5, 2025)
- **Backend Relocation**: Moved `streaming_server.py` to root folder as dedicated GUI backend
- **Capability Integration**: Full delegation to `RealtimeDataStreaming` capability - **ZERO code duplication**
- **Method Delegation**: 
  - Uses `data_streamer._decode_and_parse_payload` for WebSocket decoding
  - Uses `data_streamer._process_chart_settings` for timeframe detection
  - Uses `data_streamer._process_realtime_update` for candle aggregation
- **State Management**: All candle/timeframe data managed by capability's CANDLES, PERIOD, SESSION flags
- **Ctx Integration**: Proper context object creation for capability methods
- **Graceful Degradation**: Backend handles Chrome unavailable (Replit) vs local with Chrome
- **Workflow Updates**: Backend now runs from root with `uv run python streaming_server.py`
- **Frontend Proxy**: Vite configured with /socket.io and /api endpoints proxied to backend
- **Architect Approved**: Production-ready architecture with zero code duplication

### Phase 10: Critical Architectural Fixes (✅ COMPLETED - October 7, 2025)
- **Asset Filtering Bug Fix**: Moved asset filtering to START of `_process_realtime_update()` to prevent unwanted asset switches when user clicks different assets in PocketOption UI
- **Duplicate Candle Formation Eliminated**: Backend now emits fully-formed candles via `candle_update` event; frontend removed duplicate 1-second candle logic (70+ lines of code deleted)
- **Encapsulation Fixed**: Created proper API methods for capability:
  - `set_asset_focus(asset)` / `release_asset_focus()` - Asset focus control
  - `set_timeframe(minutes, lock)` / `unlock_timeframe()` - Timeframe management  
  - `get_latest_candle(asset)` / `get_current_asset()` - Data access
- **Backend Refactored**: `streaming_server.py` now uses API methods instead of direct internal state manipulation (removed 4 points of broken encapsulation)
- **Data Flow Simplified**: Single source of truth - capability processes & forms candles → server emits → frontend displays
- **Backpressure Handling**: Added 1000-item buffer limit in frontend to prevent memory issues when backend sends faster than frontend can process
- **Port Configuration Fixed**: Vite now correctly serves on port 5000 instead of 5173
- **Code Quality**: Removed duplicate logic, improved maintainability with clean API boundaries

### Agent Memory System (✅ COMPLETED)
- **Memory Structure**: Complete `.agent-memory/` directory with all required files
- **Project Context**: Comprehensive project documentation and goals
- **Technical Documentation**: Architecture patterns, technologies, and constraints
- **Development Guidelines**: `.agentrules` file with project-specific standards
